Bootstrap was used for the project using npm (https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/frontend)<br /> 
To calculate the gross margin, the following formula was used: <br /> (Total Income â€“ Cost of sale of the product * quantity of the product sold)/Total Income x 100<br /> 
To start, run composer update in cmd and install the database, use the full path in .env 
DB_DATABASE = "../testTask/database/database.sqlite";
